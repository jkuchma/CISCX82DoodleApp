Short Description:
This is my Doodle App which I have developed for Android devices using Android Studio. In this app, you can draw around the canvas and change the color, opacity, brush width, and clear the canvas.

How to Run:
Pull from this repo
Open Android Studio and put this project into a directory
Click the green triangle (play button) to run the app
Note: Make sure the target API is 21+ and the emulated phone is somewhat modern. (I used Pixel 9 Pro API 35)
